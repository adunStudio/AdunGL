GLSL 존나 어려워! ㅋㅋㅋ

The storage qualifiers in and out actually have a purpose that contains and supersedes that of varying and attribute. They define what variables are respectively inputs and outputs for the shader. See the GLSL 4.2 reference card page 7:

in: linkage into shader from previous stage
out: linkage out of a shader to next stage
attribute: same as in for vertex shader
varying: same as out for vertex shader, same as in for fragment shader

/////////


#version 110

attribute vec2 position;
varying vec2 texcoord;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
    texcoord = position * vec2(0.5) + vec2(0.5);
}



It should be rewritten in 4.2 core as:




#version 420

in vec2 position;
out vec2 texcoord;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);
    texcoord = position * vec2(0.5) + vec2(0.5);
}
